### Description

One thought going through backend developers mind is always: "Could this be automated?"
Well, look no further - Be-Generic enables any developer to set up a base project really easy while they are preparing their database. 
Using Be-Generic, you can skip the implementation of mundane code that can be autogenerated based on ERM-UML transcription data and focus more on the code that represents clients custom implementations. 

### Functionalities

- Easily define entities and client-side properties using SQL
- Expand objects and send additional data to Front End without needing to change code
- Override any Be-Generic controller with custom code (by creating actual controller class)
- Attach pre- and post- actions to Generic controller controllers, for example to delete profile image after deleting user profile
- Use auto-generated Entity Framework classes (based on SQL definition)
- Use Front-End and Back-End security filters to improve security and time of development
